**Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**

In the **Starry Night** example, **the flowing lines** are not just a visual effect; they seem to breathe life into the scene, making it vibrant and dynamic. I wish to incorporate this effect into my project because it can simulate natural phenomena found in the real world, such as wind, water currents, or flames, offering users a genuine and immersive experience. This also aligns with the animated effects demonstrated by the "Random Seed" requirement in the assignment.
